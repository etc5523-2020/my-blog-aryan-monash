# Data Description

The data was sourced from COVID-19 Data Hub, Journal of Open Source Software which compiled the data from various sources. 

The data includes cumulative death count, confirmed case count, test count, recovery count, patients in hospital, patients in ICU, number of patients on ventilator support as well as information about various policy measures on schools, workplace, gatherings, stay-home restrictions, testing policies and government stringency.

```{r, cache=TRUE}

Sweden’s unorthodox approach to the infamous COVID-19 pandemic gained tremendous attention from the media around the world and even earned a moniker “the Swedish experiment”. According to the government officials, like most other countries in the world, it too was working towards minimising transmission but it was also quite focused on minimising social and economical damage. 

The Scandinavian nation kept most of its schools and childcare health facilities open and accessible throughout the outbreak. The implementation of the soft lockdown meant that much of the measures for social distancing relied on voluntary action. 

The country’s chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell believed that the non-compulsory measures would drastically reduce the reproductive rate of infection and keeping school’s and businesses open would help reach herd immunity faster. (Brennan, 2020)

```

As seen in the Table \@ref(fig:tab1), the country started testing for the virus on January 1, 2020 and encountered its first positive case on February 4 followed by the first death due to virus on March 11.

It can also be observed that from September onward even the voluntary measures were lifted from schools and businesses along with the restrictions on gatherings and international travel.

```

The Table \@ref(fig:tab2) shows clearly that the country was hit quite severely and the peak death count is among the worst even for such a low density population.
The Foreign minister suggest that Sweden’s economy is largely export driven and that every 3rd job is tied to export (Henley, 2020). Sweden’s Getinge Group is also among the largest ventilator exporter in the world (Tiwari, 2020).

# Conclusion

While the approach Sweden took to fight the outbreak may remain controversial forever, there are enough facts supporting both sides of the arguments. The trust-based social distancing may not work in most parts of the world but it may have worked to some extent for Sweden. Although Sweden’s per capita death rate was among the highest (Secon, 2020), it should also be noted there are severe downsides of stricter lockdowns too, such as lose of jobs, depression, postponed healthcare and even delay of justice. Nevertheless, it would be quite interesting to observe how the world will look towards Sweden’s approach years from now even though we may never be able to decisively conclude whether “The Swedish Experiment” was in-fact a success or a failure.
